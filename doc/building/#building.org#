First build requirements listed in [[file:requirements.org]].

#+title: Building
#+begin_src fish
  mkdir builddir
  cd builddir
  cmake -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=$HOME/.local -GNinja ..
  cmake --build .
#+end_src


*** notes

There's a lot of "legacy" linking in the cmake files, that is linking a library like:
#+BEGIN_SRC cmake
target_link_libraries(whatever osg)
#+END_SRC
where osg is not a cmake target. This causes -losg to be added to the compiler command line,
which can cause unexpected symbol search issues. You can set the environment variable ~LIBRARY_PATH~ to
work around this
